### Hi there 👋

**About Me**: Briefly, my curiosity in IT sparked during my law studies. After completing my degree and undertaking extensive internships in business and criminal law, I pivoted to pursue IT at the **42 School of Paris**. This journey has been nothing short of transformative.

In this repository, I display my work from the **42 School of Paris**: 
- 📚 [42 School Curriculum](https://github.com/mathieugruson/42_school_cursus)

You'll also find some side projects I undertook for pleasure or to explore new ideas:
- 🌟 [Poplaw Public](https://github.com/mathieugruson/poplaw_public) - Exploring legal tech innovations.
- 🔍 [AMF Scrapping](https://github.com/mathieugruson/amf_scrapping) - A dive into data extraction from financial domains.

For a glimpse into my professional coding standards, check out this freelance project where I've prioritized clean and reusable code:
- 💼 [Graph Matching](https://github.com/mathieugruson/graph_matching)

**BUT**, there's one project that truly encapsulates my heart and soul—even though it didn’t pan out as hoped. I’ve poured everything into it, and I highly recommend checking it out to really gauge my abilities:
- 🌍 [Release Soon](https://github.com/mathieugruson/release_soon) - Stay tuned!
