### Hi there 👋

Briefly, my curiosity in IT sparked during my law studies. After completing my degree and undertaking extensive internships in business and criminal law, I pivoted to pursue IT at the **42 School of Paris**. This journey has been amazing so far. You can look at some projet I share in my github.

In this repository, I display my work from the **42 School of Paris**: 
- 📚 [42 School Curriculum](https://github.com/mathieugruson/42_school_cursus)

You will also find some little side projects I did to show some idea that I have pursued for pleasure or to see if there is something to dig :
- 🌟 [Poplaw Public](https://github.com/mathieugruson/poplaw_public) - Exploring how to gather all law articles in one place.
- 🔍 [AMF Scrapping](https://github.com/mathieugruson/amf_scrapping) - How to extract data from AMF without API.

Nevertheless, if you want to see how i code when it matters, you can look this freelance project where I tried to do some clean and reusable code:
- 💼 [Graph Matching](https://github.com/mathieugruson/graph_matching)

**BUT**, there is one project where I put my all my energy during five months into even if it did not succeed infortunality. I explain everything there and I strongly recommand you to look at it if you want to gauge my abilities:
- ⚖️ [docufind project](https://github.com/mathieugruson/docufind_project) - Pain point : lawyer face some time really huge huge docs
